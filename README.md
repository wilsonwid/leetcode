# leetcode
All the Leetcode practice questions I'm doing / have done!

### File organisation
All code files are grouped into their respective problem folders. Each folder contains
solutions in one (or more) languages.

### Disclaimer
* Some of the solutions actually come from other people and I've decided to put them here for my own (and your) learning purposes. 
* I don't agree with copying solutions as there is no learning to be done by doing so, but
  there are times where we might be truly lost in solving a problem and hence require certain
  'hints' or 'guidance'. I am making this repository to be such a source.
