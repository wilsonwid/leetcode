# leetcode
All the Leetcode practice questions I'm doing / have done!

### File organisation
Code is grouped into their respective problem folders. Each folder contains solutions in one (or more) languages (usually Python and C++, but I may add Java for fun in the future :O)

### Disclaimers
* Some of the solutions actually come from other people and I've decided to put them here for my own (and your) learning purposes. 
* I don't agree with blatantly copying solutions as there is no learning to be done by doing so, but there are times when we might require hints from others :)
